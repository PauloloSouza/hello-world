# readme-edits
Hello everyone, my name is Paulo, I'm from Brazil. Like i have writed in my profile: I have patience to solve problemes, and i found myself in programing. Write codes and then see them working its amazing.

I'm now studying and learning, had done some little projects to myself, and projects in courses, nothing so big. I'm focusing in Back-End, so, I'm searching for a remote job inside my country or an international contract. This will be my fisrt job contact with developement area, however i'm very excited.

Thanks for read, support or any contribution!
